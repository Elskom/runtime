    <Description>A cleaned up and bug fixed version of zlib.net. This is also planned to be updated frequently if needed too.</Description>
    <PackageReleaseNotes>Changes:
      - Reduced TFM's on the package from 19 to 1.
      - Embed the pdb inside of the binaries.
      - Inflate, Deflate, ZlibCompressionState, ZlibCompressionStrategy, and ZlibFlushStrategy are now internal.
      - Added ZlibVersion() and ZlibGetAdler32() to the MemoryZlib class.
      - Removed deprecated methods inside of the MemoryZlib class.
      - Removed the ZlibConst, ZStream and the SupportClass classes as they became useless.
      - ZStreamException has been removed entirely, NotPackableException and NotUnpackableException makes it more clear if error happened during compressing or decompressing anyway.
      - use simplified using statements instead of blocks in MemoryZlib since all the methods do is use the streams to do compression/decompression.
      - Removed unused internal/private methods as well too (dead code).
      - Removed ZImputStream and ZOutputStream and replacted it with ZlibStream.
      - Added Compression levels 2 ~ 8 to ZlibCompression.
      - Replaced output parameters on methods inside of the MemoryZlib class to return values.
      - Renamed Compress methods that return an Adler32 hash to CompressHash.
      - Removed parameterless constructor on NotPackableException and NotUnpackableException.</PackageReleaseNotes>
